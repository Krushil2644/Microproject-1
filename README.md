# Microproject-1
This project is a **Node.js & Express** web application that serves a **static website** with an integrated JSON API. It includes a well-designed homepage, a product listing page that fetches data dynamically from the server, and a professional-looking contact page. The website uses **modern UI styling**, smooth animations, and a responsive layout to ensure a great user experience. The API is implemented using Express, serving JSON data from a local file, and the front-end dynamically fetches and displays the data using **Async/Await**. To run the project, install dependencies using `npm install` and start the server with `nodemon app.js`. Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to explore the site.
